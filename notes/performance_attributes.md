* often slow down at the end of a phrase preparing a new one
* often the start of a phrase coincides with a significant and durable change in velocity (either we crescendo up to the start of the phrase, or the end of the last phrase becomes very quiet, and the new one starts quiet as well)

I struggle to find other performance attributes, so if you observe other ones don't hesitate to add them.
