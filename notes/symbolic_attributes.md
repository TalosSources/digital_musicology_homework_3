* typical length of phrases:
    - for the main theme: almost always 4 measures, but can prolonged/shortened to 2 and/or 6 for "extensions"
    - in the middle part: 3 measures? then 4 then 2? then some 2s, and 4s. towards the end, some measures could be considered 1-long phrases
    - -> many of them can become their double if we consider the higher nesting level of phrases
    - -> also, we can write that even though the typical length for a phrase is 8 measures, this piece features 8 quarter notes per measure (instead of the typical 4), which is particularly long, so 4 measure phrases are actually the "typical" length. 
* often ends in the tonic: either the tonic fundamental (fundamental=the tonic is the lowest note) chord at the left hand, or a note from the tonic chord in the melody
    (in our case, the tonic can be Gb, and Eb for the minor parts)
* phrases very often end with measures, and end on a relatively long note at the melody (whole notes or half notes)
* maybe some sort of mountain shape for the density of notes in the melody (long/few notes in the beginning, then fast/many notes in the middle then long/few notes in the end)
