[notes I took about rule-based phrase detection during the ex. session]

* start with simple rules

one simple heuristic: long silence 


Temperley(2001) system:
aspects:
1. gaps in symbolic time
	use IOI and OOI to define the gap
2. prior on phrase length
	in classical: typically 8.
	rule-out / make less probable
3. parallelism on the metrical location
