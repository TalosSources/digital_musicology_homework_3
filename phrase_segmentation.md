tree like structure.

part 1: (1 to 24) [main theme]
    A (1 to 8)
        A1 (1 to 4) 
            T1 (1 to 2)
            T2 (3 to 4)
        A2 (5 to 8)
            T1 (5 to 6)
            T2' (7 to 8)
            -> period structure for A

        B1 (9 to 12)
            T3 (9 to 10)
            T3' (11 to 12)

            T4 (13)
            T4' (14)
            T4'' (15-16) # approximative
    B' (17 to 24)
        same structure as B, but with variated measures
part 2: (25 to 54) [development with parts in Eb minor]
    C (25 to 31)
        C1 (25 to 27)
            T5 (25)
            T6 (26 to 27)
                T6A (26)
                T6B (27)
        C2 (28 to 31)
            T5' (28)
            T6' (29 to 31)
                T6A' (29)
                T6B' (30)
                T6B'' (31) -> with modulation
    D (32 to 34)
        D1 (32)
        D2 (33 to 34)
    E (35 to 39)
        E1 (35 to 36)
        E1' (37 to 38) [with different harmony]
        E2 (39) [transition to F]
    F (40 to 47) [quite similar to C]
        F1 (40 to 43)
            T7 (40 to 41)
            T8 (42 to 43)
        F2 (44 to 47)
            T7' (44 to 45)
            T8' (46 to 47) 
    D' (48 to 50) -> like D but in another tonality
    G (51 to 54) -> transition/modulation back to the main theme
        G1 (51 to 52)
        G2 (53 to 54)
part 3: (55 to 74) [main theme variated]
    A' (55 to 62) very slightly different from A
    B'' (63 to 74)
        B1'  (63 to 66)
        B2' (67 to 71)
            T4 (67)
            T4' (68)
            T4'' (69) split-measure (unclear with the other T4'', microphrases?) -> from there measures on musescore are 1 measure ahead
            T9? (70) [unique transition motif]
        B2'' (71 to 73)
            T4''' (71)
            T4'''' (72)
            T4'' (73) [the primes make no sense anymore]
part 4: (74 to 87) [ending]
    H (74 to 82)
        H1 (74 to 77)
            T10 (74 to 76) [similar to G1]
            T11 (77) 
        H1'(78 to 81) split-measure -> from there measures on musescore are 2 measures ahead
            T10' (78 to 80)
            T11 (81)
    I (82 to 83)
        I1 (82)
        I1' (83)
    J (84 to 86)
        [pompous ending, could be seen as only one phrase]
