            T1 (1 to 2)
            T2 (3 to 4)
        A2 (5 to 8)
            T1 (5 to 6)
            T2' (7 to 8)
            -> period structure for A
    B (9 to 16)
        B1 (9 to 12)
            T3 (9 to 10)
            T3' (11 to 12)
        B2 (13 to 16)
            T4 (13)
            T4' (14)
            T4'' (15-16) # approximative
    B' (17 to 24)
        same structure as B, but with variated measures
part 2: (25 to 54) [development with parts in Eb minor]
    C (25 to 31)
        C1 (25 to 27)
            T5 (25)
            T6 (26 to 27)
                T6A (26)

        C2 (28 to 31)
            T5' (28)
            T6' (29 to 31)
                T6A' (29)
                T6B' (30)
                T6B'' (31) -> with modulation
    D (32 to 34)
    E (35 to 39)
    F (40 to 47)
    D' (48 to 50) -> like D but in another tonality
    G (51 to 54) -> transition/modulation back to the main theme
part 3: (55 to 74) [main theme variated]
    A' (55 to 62) very slightly different from A
    B'' (63 to 74)
        B1 (63 to 66) (check that's like the other B1, if not B1')
        B2' (67 to 71)
            ...
        B2'' (72 to 74)
            ...
part 4: (75 to 88) [ending]
    H (75 to 83)
        ...
